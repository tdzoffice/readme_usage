# How to Add Titles, Subtitles, and Paragraphs in GitHub README.md

This guide explains how to format your GitHub README.md to include titles, subtitles, and paragraphs using Markdown.

## Adding Titles

You can create titles and subtitles by using `#` symbols followed by a space. For example:

```markdown ```
# Main Title
## Subtitle

Adding Paragraphs
To include paragraphs of text, simply write your content as you normally would:

This is a paragraph of text. You can write about your project, provide descriptions, and more.

Lists
You can create ordered and unordered lists using *, -, or + for unordered, and numbers for ordered lists. For example:

Unordered list:

•  Item 1

•  Item 2

•  Item 3


Ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Adding Links
To add links to other web pages or resources, use square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL. For example:

[GitHub](https://github.com)

Formatting Text
You can format text as bold, italic, or strikethrough using *, _, and ~~, respectively. For example:

[**This is bold text.**](https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=This%20is%20bold%20text.)
_This is italic text._
~~This is strikethrough text.~~

Adding Images
To include images, use an exclamation mark ! followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the image URL. For example:

![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
